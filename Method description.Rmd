# Method for testing causal relationship

This document describes the testing function for a relationship between a causal and a result events. 
The document also contains the implementation of the test function for causal relations of events in the delivery and impact pathway of agro-climate services (ACS) in two farmers groups in Dien Bien, Vietnam. 
The testing is programmed with the `gsDesign` package [@anderson_gsdesign_2021]. The full testing procedure is available in the [ACS-adoption-Pathway repository](https://github.com/ThiThuGiangLuu/ACS-adoption-decision-pathway). 

### Description of variables collected from farmer survey 

`diffusion-variable-description.xlsx` contains data for general statistics and for testing. The tables contains information including name of variable; description of variable, type of variable values and which question is the questionnaire was used to get the data for that variable. Download the table from the [ACS-adoption-Pathway repository](https://github.com/ThiThuGiangLuu/ACS-adoption-decision-pathway).

### Data table 

The data table `diffusion.csv` contains surveyed data for general statistics and data used for testing. The table includes the variable names and its values. Download the table from the [ACS-adoption-Pathway repository](https://github.com/ThiThuGiangLuu/ACS-adoption-decision-pathway).

We call the data file for analysis

```{r}
diffusion <- read.csv("diffusion.csv", header=TRUE)
```

### Development of the test function 

The testing function `test_relationship` described in this document is programmed in the R programming language [@r_core_team_r:_2020]. The testing function that is described here can also be found in the [ACS-adoption-Pathway repository](https://github.com/ThiThuGiangLuu/ACS-adoption-decision-pathway). 

The testing is aimed for validating causal relationships between causal and resulting events, which are both binomially distributed. We do so by comparing the two "success" rates of the resulting event brought about in the presence and absence of the "hypothesized" causal event. The two success rates are calculated as the probability of observing “successful event” together with causal event [yes] observations and the probability to observe “successful event”/ [yes] observations together with causal event [no] observations. These observations are obtained from farmer survey sample. 

We use the `ciBinomial` function in `gsDesign` package [@anderson_gsdesign_2021] to calculate the confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the two rates. 


The test outcomes include the observation of both intervention and impact events, the success rates and the confidence intervals of the difference between the two success rates.  

```{r}
test_relationship<-function(data, intervention, impact)
{
  
  # Intervention means causal event with [yes] observation
  # But for simplification, we call it "intervention".
  # intervention_subset: List all the impact observation under intervention condition 
  # Check the return results in the global environment for more details of the calculation
  # Remove NAs value. Otherwise it will also count NA value as 1
  intervention_subset <- na.exclude(data[data[intervention]==1, impact] )
  
  # control_subset: List all the impact observation under control condition 
  # control means causal variable with [no] observation. It might not really be control. 
  # However, to make it simple, we call it "control".
  # Remove NAs value. Otherwise it will also count NA value as 0
  control_subset <- na.exclude(data[data[intervention]==0, impact] )
  
  #n of intervention. This length is also equal to the count of impact observation under intervention condition
  intervention_subset_n <- length(intervention_subset)
  
  #n of control. The length is also equal to the count of impact observations under control condition 
  control_subset_n <- length(control_subset)
  
  #filtering for '1' to get success count
  intervention_subset_success <- length(which(intervention_subset==1))
  
  #filter for '1' to count success despite no intervention
  control_subset_success <- length(which(control_subset==1))
 
  
  #Confidence interval of likelihood of same outcome in control condition
  confinf<-ciBinomial(x1 = intervention_subset_success, #number of success in attributable to intervention
                      x2 = control_subset_success, #number of success attributable to control
                      n1 = intervention_subset_n, #length of impact observation under intervention
                      n2 = control_subset_n) #length of impact observation under control

   return(list(#n observation under all conditions
              total_n = intervention_subset_n+control_subset_n, 
              # Return observations under intervention  
              Intervention_subset=intervention_subset, 
              #x1 for success under intervention
              x1_intervention_subset_success=intervention_subset_success,
              #n1 for all interventions
              n1_intervention_subset_n = intervention_subset_n,
              #rate of success for intervention group
              yes_rate_intervention_subset = length(which(intervention_subset==1))/(intervention_subset_n),
              # Return observations under control
              Control_subset=control_subset,
              #x2 for success under control
              x2_control_subset_success=control_subset_success,
              #n2 for all control
              n2_control_subset_n = control_subset_n,
              #rate of success despite no intervention
              yes_rate_control_subset = length(which(control_subset==1))/(control_subset_n),
              #Confidence intervals for rate of success in intervention condition compared with control condition
              CI = confinf ))
}
```

After obtaining the confidence interval value, we interpret the causal relation of the causal and resulting events using our proposed procedure. The procedure aims at interpreting CI in a practical context. In this procedure, we compare CI with a pre-defined range of practical indifference. If the CI lays completely within the range of practical indifference, the difference was considered practically irrelevant or trivial. We also considered other possibilities of the CI value when compared with the range of practical indifference that might lead to other possible interpretations. Depending on the range of CI, we considered the causal and resulting events to have no, potential, weak, moderate or strong relationships. We adapted the matrix of the strength of evidence by [@mcbride_assessing_2013] and proposed our interpretation of CI for the difference of the two proportions (see below Table).

### Implement the test for the agro-climate service delivery and adoption impact pathway

We test the causal relations of each sub-hypothesis described in the hypothesized ACS delivery and adoption impact pathway using testing function `test_relationship`. For example, we test the difference between access rate among village saving and loan association (VSLA) farmers needing and not needing ACS in the following function.  


```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Subsetting VSLA data for analysis

vsla<-subset(diffusion,VSLA=="1")

# Implement testing function

vslaneed_access <- test_relationship(vsla,"need","access")

```

Below is the test outcomes of the relationship between "need" and "access", in which


Test outcomes   |  Meaning
 ---------------|  -------------- 
 total_n   |  total observations of "access" in all "need[yes]" and "need[no] conditions"
 Intervention_subset   |  list all the "access[yes]" and "access[no]"observation in the presence of "need[yes]"
 x1_intervention_subset_success   |  number of "access[yes]" attributable to "need[yes}" (x1)
 n1_intervention_subset_n   |  length of intervention_subset (n1)
 yes_rate_intervention_subset   |  successful "access" rate in the presence of "need[yes]" (x1/n1)
 Control_subset  |  list all the "access[yes]" and "access[no]"observation in the presence of "need[no]" 
 x2_control_subset_success   |  number of "access[yes]" attributable to "need[no}" (x2)
 n2_control_subset_n   |  length of control_subset (n2)
 yes_rate_control_subset   |  successful "access" rate in the presence of "need[no]" (x2/n2)
 CI   |  Confidence interval of "access" rate difference between VSLA farmers who have "need" and VSLA farmers without "need"


```{r, echo=FALSE}
vslaneed_access

We are especially grateful to the support of Ms. Huong Tong from the Centre for Community Development in Dien Bien and other local collaborators for their excellent support in arranging interviews in Dien Bien. This research would not have been possible without the active participation of the farmers who were willing to share their personal experiences in using agro-climate services.
