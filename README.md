# ACS-adoption-decision-pathway 

[Repository](https://github.com/ThiThuGiangLuu/ACS-adoption-decision-pathway) that includes the method, data and supplementary documents for the delivery and impact pathway testing procedure of agro-climate services (ACS) in two farmers groups in Dien Bien, Vietnam. 

### The R project
`ACS-adoption-decision-pathway.Rproj` is where we stored our R project.

### Supplementary Information 1: Supplementary materials

`SI1-Supplementary.html`describes the process to develop an impact pathway and the testing function for a relationship between  hypothesized cause and effect events. 
The document also includes description of all other supplementary files. 

### Supplementary Information 2: Farmer survey
`SI2-Questionnaire.pdf` contains the set of questions used in the farmer survey, aiming for testing the conceptual impact pathways

### Supplementary information 3: Description of variables collected from farmer survey
`SI3-diffusion-variable-description.xlsx` contains data for general statistics and for testing. The tables contains information including name of variable; description of variable, type of variable values and which question is the questionnaire was used to get the data for that variable

### Supplementary information 4: Data table
The data table `diffusion.csv` contains surveyed data for general statistics and data used for testing. The table includes the variable names and its values

### Supplementary Information 5: R code of the model testing
`Diffusion.R` contains full code for model testing

### Supplementary Information 6: Impact pathway validation and detailed results of the testing

`SI6-detailed results of the tests.pdf` contains all detailed results of model testing
